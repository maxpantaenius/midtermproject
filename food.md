I love all kinds of pasta, but spaghetti and meatballs tops my list. I have always wanted to travel to Italy and try authentic pasta. My hope is that I can travel to Italy and other neighboring countries as well. During my time in grad school, I hope to get experience studying abroad.

Here is another piece of code that I worked on:

cone_radius = float(input("Enter the cone's radius as a decimal: "))
cone_height = float(input("Enter the cone's height as a decimal: "))
pi = 3.14159265359

volume = pi * cone_radius * cone_radius * (cone_height/3)

print("Volume = ", volume)
