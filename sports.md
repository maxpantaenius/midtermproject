#My Favorite Sports Teams
Here is a list of my favorite teams:

- *Kansas City Chiefs*

Baseball is my favorite sport and I'm excited for the upcoming MLB season. I attended a **Royals Spring Training** game and they won!

#####This was another piece of Python code I am proud of:

import turtle 

shape = turtle.Turtle()

for i in range(10):
    shape.forward(i * 20)
    shape.right(288)
    
turtle.done()
