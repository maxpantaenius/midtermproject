I am excited to learn more in this class and continue to apply my coding experience outside of class! Python has been my favorite coding language we have covered thus far, but I am looking forward to diving into other coding languages further. 

With enough practice, I hope to write my own program someday. Learning code is like learning any other spoken language; it requires repititon and determination. 

#####Here is the Python code I wrote for the first assignment:

print('Hello, my name is Max.')

print('I am a Senior at Mizzou studying business.')

print('I am from Kansas City.')

print('Lets go Chiefs!')
